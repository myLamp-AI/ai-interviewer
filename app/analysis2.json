            "hello! i'm sarah from the hr team it's great to meet you today, anish let's start by introducing yourself?": "Hi, So i am ANish Kumar, I am currently pursuing MAchine LEarning and ENginnering from IIIT Ranchi, I have worked on projects such as AI-CV Reviewer and AI INterviewer, where the prior is used to review the CV of student and suggest them ideas such that they can improve their resume incresing their chance of selection, the former works as an HR which can replace take interviewes so that every candidate can have equal chances of selction. Other than that, I have also build a project where i scrpaed blogs of Will Koherensen, CLeaned data and didi different analysis like topic modelling sentiment analysis, Other than my professional work my hobbies include playing football and listening to songs",
            "that's really impressive, anish! it sounds like you have a strong passion for ai and a drive to use it for positive impact can you tell me more about your experience with the ai-cv reviewer project?": "Well, i had a very positive expeience, like the project was to be made in a development sprint, and as soon as i hearn i had no idea on how to develop such a project, but there is site called resume worded i used it itried to understand it, After 2 days i build a simple prototypeof how everything will work than we continued to build upon that adding more metrics to review the project",
            "that's great to hear, anish! it sounds like you were able to learn quickly and adapt to the project requirements can you tell me more about the challenges you faced while working on the ai-cv reviewer project?": "well, the challenges was mostly writing correct prompt or making the ai understand what i want to do with data, also since the data provided by ai has to be relevant, so i studied about prompt engineering how to acheive this, i started asking for reasonong which helped in geenerating beter answer"
